            Please provide the response as a JSON object without any markdown elements or formatting. Format the story as a JSON object with each sentence as a separate entry in an array of sentences under the 'sentences' property. Additionally, generate a unique and creative title for the story and include it in a separate property called 'Title' in the JSON response object. DO NOT include any additional formatting or markdown.       
            Crucially, EVERY sentence must include these details:
            * **Central Character:**  Always mention the main character by name. Provide a detailed description of their appearance, personality, attire, accessories, and any unique attributes like clothing, toys, skin color, hair/fur color,etc in EVERY sentence. Use vivid language and sensory details. Ensure these details remain consistent across all sentences in which the central character appears.  Be extremely repetitive with explicit details.
            * **Scene:**  Vividly describe the setting in EVERY sentence, including the time of day, weather, and specific details about the environment. Use descriptive language to create a strong visual image. Ensure these details remain consistent across all sentences.  If the scene changes, the same rule applies for the new scene as well.  Be extremely repetitive with explicit details.
            * **Supporting Characters:** Describe any supporting characters in detail, including their appearance, personality, and relationship to the main character. Ensure these details remain consistent across all sentences in which the supporting characters appear. Be extremely repetitive with explicit details.
            * **Objects/Items:** Describe any objects or items or artifacts that appear in the scene in detail, including their appearance, function, and significance to the story. Ensure these details remain consistent across all sentences in which the objects/items appear. Be extremely repetitive with explicit details
